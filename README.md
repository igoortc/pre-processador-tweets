# Tweets preprocessor

Author: Igor Tannus Correa

This is a Java algorithm that executes several steps of pre-processing in a database. At first, it was written as a tweet's pre-processor, but it can be adapted to other types of data.

This algorithm is part of the paper that I wrote, "Sentiment analysis of tweets related to the movies nominated for the 2017 Academy Awards".
